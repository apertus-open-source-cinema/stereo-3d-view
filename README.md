# stereo-3d-view
OBS plugins for stereo 3d related workflows

# Prerequisites 
Software:
* OBSÂ® Studio (https://obsproject.com/)
* StreamFX (https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX)

Hardware: 
To get  live video of two cameras into OBS you require hardware that can capture two video streams.

# Usage
## Anaglyph Mode

The basic idea is to use an additive shader that combines two image/video sources together. For anaglyph mode a corresponding *Color Grading* filter for each source removes either the red or blue color channels (for red/blue color glasses). A *3D Transform* filter can be used to offset the two images if required for the convergence adjustment.
